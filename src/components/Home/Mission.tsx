              The Victor and Lois Foundation is a non-profit, faith-based
              organization established in Lagos, Nigeria in 2024. It is worthy
              to note that the founding fathers have been working among drug
              addicts and prostitutes since 1986. <br />
              Our primary objective is to reach out to drug addicts, alcoholics,
              prostitutes, vulnerable children and those with failed marriages
              with the intention to resuscitate hope and give their lives
              meaning.
